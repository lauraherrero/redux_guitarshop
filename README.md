Project based on a store selling guitars. 
It is possible to visualize a list of guitars through a request in a DB. In addition, it is possible to add different models to the shopping cart. 

By pressing the cart button, it is possible to see a summary of the purchase, with an image, name, price and quantity of the selected guitars. You can also see the total price to be paid. 

You can also increase or decrease the number of guitars already selected by changing the quantity in the shopping cart. It is possible to remove a specific model and finally, the shopping cart can be completely emptied.

The application also allows you to keep the information saved even if you reload it thanks to the implementation of localstorage.



## Technology Stack üíª
The application has been made from scratch with React using Vite and a store has been used to manage different states of the application. Also react redux has been used to help the handling of reducers and actions.
